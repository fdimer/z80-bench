# Z80 Bench

A Z80 CPU emulator for debugging programs and designing hardware around the chip. It runs in a web browser and shows the state of all 40 pins on every T-state.

**Try it online:** <https://fdimer.github.io/z80-bench/app/>

Open `z80-bench.html` in any web browser, from this folder on your computer (it loads the CPU core and assembler from `src/`). It needs no installation or internet connection; the web fonts fall back to system fonts offline.

To get a single self-contained file instead, run `python build.py`, which writes `z80-bench-standalone.html`.


## Z80 SIO/2 (sio branch)

This branch adds the first peripheral: a Zilog Z80 SIO/2 serial controller wired as on the RC2014.

- **Wiring:** ports 80h–83h (A control, A data, B control, B data). A0, inverted, drives C/D and A1 drives B/A. The base port can be changed in the System panel.
- **Clocks:** /TxC and /RxC are tied to the system clock, so on a 7.3728 MHz RC2014 the ×64 mode gives 115,200 baud. Timing is counted in T-states, so characters take the right number of clocks.
- **Asynchronous mode on both channels:** 5–8 data bits, parity, 1/1.5/2 stop bits and ×1/×16/×32/×64 clocks. TxD and RxD are bit-accurate (start, data, parity and stop bits).
- **Buffers:** a 3-byte receive FIFO with overrun detection, and a transmit buffer plus shift register.
- **Registers and commands:** every WR0 command, WR1–WR5, and RR0–RR2.
- **Modem lines:** /RTS and /DTR outputs. /CTS and /DCD are inputs you can click, and auto enables work.
- **Interrupts:** the six internal sources in Zilog priority order, interrupt mode 2 vectors with "status affects vector", and the daisy chain (IEI tied high, IEO shown). The interrupt acknowledge cycle puts the vector on the bus. RETI is recognised by watching the ED 4D opcode fetches, as the real chip does.
- **Pinout:** a 40-pin SIO/2 view that updates every clock alongside the Z80.
- **Register view:** each channel's decoded configuration and baud rate, FIFO and buffers, and pending and in-service interrupts.
- **Terminal:** one per channel. Type or paste to send to RxD at the line rate; whatever the program sends on TxD appears on screen. Hardware flow control on /RTS is optional.
- **Examples** (in the SIO panel): a polled echo and an interrupt-driven (IM 2) echo.

Synchronous and SDLC modes and the wait/ready function are not emulated yet. Run the chip's own tests with `node tests/sio-test.js`.

## Features

- **Pinout**: 40-pin DIP view that updates every T-state (high, low, or floating). Click the input pins to drive them:
  - CLK pulses one clock
  - /INT is level-sensitive and honours EI/DI and IM 0/1/2
  - /NMI triggers on a falling edge
  - /WAIT inserts wait states at the correct sampling point
  - /BUSREQ floats the buses at the end of the machine cycle and asserts /BUSACK
  - /RESET holds the CPU in reset and restarts at 0000h
- **Program input**: switch between Assembly and Hex.
  - Assembly: standard Zilog syntax, labels, ORG, EQU, DB, DW, DS, END, expressions, and the undocumented instructions.
  - Hex: bytes with optional `ADDR:` jumps, or Intel HEX.
  - **Import file…** (or drop a file on the editor): `.asm`/`.z80`/`.s` go to Assembly; `.hex`/`.ihx` and plain hex text go to Hex; raw `.bin`/`.rom` images are converted to hex.
  - **Load at** sets where code goes in memory, e.g. the start of ROM in your memory map. In Assembly it applies until the first `ORG`; Intel HEX keeps its own addresses.
  - "Copy bytes to Hex tab" turns assembled code into an annotated hex listing.
- **Memory**: 1–64 KB installed. Above the top, reads return FFh or mirror the installed memory. Bytes are editable in the memory view.
- **Stepping**: one T-state, one instruction, or run at 5 Hz, 50 Hz, 1 kHz, 5 kHz, 10 kHz or full speed.
- **Breakpoints**: click a line in the disassembly to cycle between *break at* (filled dot: stops before the instruction runs), *break after* (ring: stops when the PC leaves that address, so an instruction that repeats in place, such as LDIR or a jump to itself, runs to completion first) and off.
- **Register stops**: click **stop** beside any register and give a hex value; the run halts at the end of the instruction that changes the register to that value, in every run mode.
- **Debug pane**: lists every breakpoint and stop, with a × to remove each and a click to jump to it. From it you can also add:
  - *memory stops*: halt after the instruction that changes the byte at an address, or changes it to a given value
  - *pin stops*: halt on the clock where a pin changes, goes high or goes low (while one is set, full speed runs clock by clock, so it is slower)
  - *bus stops*: halt on the clock where the address bus or data bus takes a given value (like pin stops, these slow full speed while set)
- **Bus timing**: waveform of /M1 /MREQ /IORQ /RD /WR /RFSH, plus address and data, for the current instruction.
- **I/O**: OUT writes are shown as 8-LED latches with a log. You can set the value IN returns for each port.

## Files

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `z80-bench.html` | The application: layout, pin model, T-state engine and panels; loads the two files in `src/` |
| `src/z80core.js` | CPU core: all instructions incl. CB/ED/DD/FD/DDCB, interrupts, HALT, per-machine-cycle bus log; disassembler |
| `src/z80asm.js` | Two-pass assembler; its opcode table is generated from the disassembler |
| `build.py` | Writes `z80-bench-standalone.html`, one file with everything inlined (`python build.py`) |
| `tests/zexdoc-run.js` | Runs the zexdoc exerciser (`node tests/zexdoc-run.js zexdoc.com`); `zexdoc.com` is not included, get it from the original ZEXALL distribution |
| `tests/timing-test.js` | Checks instruction T-state counts against the datasheet |
| `tests/asm-test.js` | Round-trips all 1,136 instruction forms through the assembler |

## Verification

- **zexdoc**: all 67 groups pass, so documented flags are correct.
- **T-states**: 49 representative instructions and interrupt responses match the Zilog datasheet.
- **Assembler**: all 1,136 instruction forms assemble to the expected bytes.

## Known limitations

- During clock stepping, registers and memory update together at the end of each instruction, not partway through it.
- In IM 0, the interrupting device can only supply an RST opcode.
- Undocumented flag bits 3 and 5 are approximate for BIT n,(HL) and the block I/O instructions.
- Peripherals (memory-mapped devices, UART, PIO, etc.) are planned next.

## Running the tests

The tests need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):

```
node tests/timing-test.js
node tests/asm-test.js
node tests/zexdoc-run.js path/to/zexdoc.com
```
